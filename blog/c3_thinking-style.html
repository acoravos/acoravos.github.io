  <h1>Unwraping my thinking style</h1>
  <h2>A Week 3 Reflection</h2>

        When I took the Gregorc Thinking Style quiz in the pre-Phase 0 section, I scored the following:
    </p>

    <p>
        <code>
          Concrete Sequential: 20
          Abstract Sequential: 16
          Abstract Random: 40
          Concrete Random: 44</code>
    </p>

    <p>
        After taking these tests, it's rather clear to me that I'm definitely a "random" thinker than a "sequential" thinker. Put another way, I've always known I'm a non-linear thinker. But I'm much closer on the "abstract" vs. "concrete" factor.
    <p>
        According to the theory, there are a couple aspects of the two models that resonate with me.
    </p>
    <p>
        CONCRETE RANDOM: I like experimenting to find answers, and I feel comfortable taking risks. I use my intuition often when testing a problem. I learn well when I do trial-and-error approaches and like working through problems on my own. I don't fully agree with the "on my own" part. I do need some time in silence to get through work, but I'm also an extroverted person and learn by testing out answers with others. The challenges wre spot on: "re-doing anything once it's done", "showing detailed reports", "formal reports", "restrictions and limitations"
    </p>
    <p>
        ABSTRACT RANDOM: I like listening to others. Although it says I like "harmony," I wouldn't say I push for harmony. I'm not worried about conflict as long as the group feels comfortable voicing varying opinions. I definitely like having healthy relationships with others. I work well in a personalized environment and when I have broad or general guidelines. And also many of the challenges were spot on: "concentrating on one thing at a time," "working with dictatorial/authoritarian personalities," and "giving exact details." In contrast to what was written, I don't mind working with unfriendly people, competition (love it) and having to explain feelings.
    </p>

        Most important thing is remembering that this framework is just that: a framework. I'm learning a lot in DBC, and my greatest struggle is mostly around finding time. I'm still working a full-time job and it's been hard to create big chunks of time to do DBC activities. These aren't easy ones to do "here and there." They require focus and intensive effort -- and when I leave my role in the next couple weeks, that space will be much more open.
