    <p> Outline:
      Classes allow us to create basic templates.
      + For example create a "child" class. It could have variables like "eat" "sleep" "play". And it also would have instance variables like @gender, @age, @sport, @race.
      + Help promotes consistence across the class.
      Introduction to "Madison"
      class Athlete
      def initialize (name, gender, age, sport, event)
      @name = name
      @gender = gender
      @age = age
      @sport = sport
      @event = event
      end
      end

      Lilly = athelete.new("Lilly", female", "12", "track and field", "400 meters")

      Sunil = athlete.net("Sunil", male", "15", "track and field", "long jump")

      class Athlete
        def athlete_profile
        puts "#{@Name} is a #{@gender} athelete, age #{@age}, and is part of the #{sport} team and will participate in the #{@event} event.

        Instance is LIlly and Sunil. How to identify?
