    <p> Programming languages generally have two compotents: data and the operations that are performed on the data. Data is static and immutable, and only the operations that are performed on it can make a change. Functions don't have a lasting state; the are only useful because they can change the underlying data. </p>
    <p> In object-oriented programm, every object has both a state (data) and behavior (operations on data). So this means that they are not so different from physical objects -- a car and piano, which embody both a state and behavior.  </p>
    <p> In functional programming, the main emphasis is on: "the function." Meaning that the existance of the function only depends on the arguments and context at the time that the function is defined.
