      If you're reading this, I'm betting that you're in my Dev Bootcamp Cohort. Odds that this is indexed as a top choice technical solution by Google is low, but I suppose not improbable. Welcome and thanks for digging in with me.

        Today, we're going to start off with the importance of ... Version Control. First off, a little background about me so you can learn my biases. I'm an operating executive at KKR Capstone where I support our private equity portfolio. One of the most painful parts of my job is when we have a big team working on multiple pieces of a project -- whether that's a model or a presentation -- and no one is responsible for the "master" copy. We realize we have about 5 different copies of the file floating around, all of which people have spent hours working on. Classic version control issue. So. much. work. lost. It's just painful.

        To help work around that issue, I've learned this week that there is this glorious solution called "git" which is a way to help multiple people track, prioritize and make changes on big projects. Git is an open source distributed version control system. It allows multiple people to work on different "branches" of the project co-currently, and then has settings to help merge them in together afterwards. This way developers are not overwriting each other when working on sections of the project.

        Git is something that is installed and used on a local computer. Users who are managing their code with git can also upload that code to a social site called "GitHub," which is effectively a social networking site that also has many useful features for sharing code. One of the aspects of the technical community that I appreciate the most is the willingness to give back by teaching others. GitHub is a prime example of this philosophy. Users post sections of their own code and also make comments and edit other code. It's a creator's paradise.
