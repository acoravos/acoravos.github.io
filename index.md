I'm Andy Coravos, a founder, writer, and researcher interested in life sciences, the brain/mind, philosophy, poetry & metaphor, and more. 

I co-founded HumanFirst, where I served as CEO for 7 years, unlocking better research for all humans, sooner. We sold the company to [ICON (NASDAQ: ICLR) in 2024](https://www.statnews.com/2024/02/29/icon-acquires-humanfirst-digital-tools-clinical-trials/). After launching the [Atlas platform](https://www.iconplc.com/solutions/outcome-measures/digital-health-technologies), I am taking a sabbatical.

I like finding things that make life better, and then scaling them so more people have access. Software and science is often the mechanism, but not always.

##  What's getting my attention today

* **Writing and Research** üìù I'll be publishing a few pieces on selling into pharma, public company M&A, and more.
* **Tinkering** üëæ I'm a big fan of side quests during sabbatical. Been playing around with LLMs, learning music, and writing comics.
* **Angel investing** üí∏ I've made 60+ angel investments. Some of my public investments are listed on [Crunchbase](https://www.crunchbase.com/discover/organizations/field/people/num_portfolio_organizations/andrea-coravos). 
* **M&A advisory** üìà I've been advising portfolio companies for the past 10 years. After we completed HumanFirst's public company transaction, I've been helping other founders navigate their M&A processes, focusing on lower to mid-market transactions (sub $250M) that boutique banks can't or won't do.


## About

While on sabbatical, I split my time between Dublin, Ireland and Brooklyn, NY. 

For the past 9 years, I've served on the Board of Directors of [VisionSpring](http://www.visionspring.org). Every year, we help hundreds of thousands of people get access to quality eye care.

Before HumanFirst, I served as an [EIR at the FDA](https://rockhealth.com/create-meaningful-change-in-healthcare-serve-a-tour-of-duty-in-government/) in the Digital Health Unit, and before that, a software engineer at [Instacart](https://tech.instacart.com/our-first-engineering-intern/) and [Akili Interactive](http://www.akiliinteractive.com/), a leader in digital medicine and developer of the [first FDA-cleared video game](https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-permits-marketing-first-game-based-digital-therapeutic-improve-attention-function-children-adhd). 

Before transitioning into engineering, I worked at KKR Capstone and McKinsey, where I focused on the healthcare, energy, and financial industries. Duke Grad. [Birder](https://bsky.app/profile/jay.bsky.team/post/3kpzw7iisxs24). Co-founded [CODE@HBS](https://codehbs.github.io/), the computer science and engineering organization at Harvard Business School. I have a not-so-secret obsession with all things Taylor Swift.

### Past Orgs and Projects
* Co-founded and CEO of [HumanFirst](https://www.gohumanfirst.com/), which we [sold to ICON plc (NASDAQ: ICLR)](https://www.statnews.com/2024/02/29/icon-acquires-humanfirst-digital-tools-clinical-trials/), enabling precision measures in clinical research. _Press: [WSJ](https://www.wsj.com/articles/humanfirst-raises-12-million-11622547001), [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/greglicholai/2022/10/04/massive-digital-library-released-to-accelerate-clinical-research-and-cut-costs/?sh=1114691d7a50), [TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/12/no-one-knows-how-effective-digital-therapies-are-but-a-new-tool-from-elektra-labs-aims-to-change-that/)._
* Founding team at [Ummo](http://www.ummoapp.com/), a personalized speech coach. Public speaking is hard, [Ummo makes it easier](http://www.businessinsider.com/ummo-app-tracks-your-speech-2016-5). Showcased by the Apple App Store as The Top 3 "Apps We Love" in Spring 2016.
* Former advisor to the [Biohacking Village at DEFCON](https://www.villageb.io/), and a proud supporter of [WeHeartHackers.org](https://wehearthackers.org/), a collaborative movement between the medical device and security researcher communities
* With a few other entrepreneurs, we launched a side-project called [#MovingForward](https://wearemovingforward.github.io/), which highlights VCs committed to diverse, inclusive, and harassment-free workplaces. _Press: [WIRED](https://www.wired.co.uk/article/movingforward-sexism-vc-ellen-pao), [CNN](http://money.cnn.com/2018/03/08/technology/movingforward-tech-vc-harassment/index.html), [Recode](https://www.recode.net/2018/3/8/17094632/venture-capital-sexual-harassment-policies-moving-forward-directory), [Pando](https://pando.com/2018/03/08/beyond-metoo-new-initiative-movingforward-seeks-hold-newly-shaken-silicon-valley-accountable/), [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2018-03-22/next-steps-for-movingforward-and-metoo-video), and [Institutional Investor](https://www.institutionalinvestor.com/article/b17hndr10zmwwb/venture-capital-has-a-%E2%80%98metoo%E2%80%99-problem-have-investors-been-ignoring-it)._


### Angel Investing Process
* **Step 1**: Send me an email; I'll review a deck, but a product I can play with is even better
* **Step 2**: Zoom meeting (30 min or so)
* **Step 3**: Asynchronous due diligence, and I'll let you know within 48 hours üí∏
